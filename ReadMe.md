TimeStamp attribute changer utility for Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP/2003

This is a small open source utility for changing the timestamp attributes of a selected set of files. Features include the setting of date and time values for creation, modify and last access attributes. These file attributes can be changed either by setting them relatively by specifying time to add/subtract or set to the current date and time. This utility also incorporates an undo functionality.

One application of this utility is to synchronize the times of sets of digital photos from different cameras whose clocks were not set correctly. For example if the difference between two cameras’ clocks was around 1 hour 5 minutes then one set of photos could have their modification times incremented by this difference. Then once all the attributes of the photos are set correctly they can be merged, sorted and viewed in sequence to give a unique picture of events.
